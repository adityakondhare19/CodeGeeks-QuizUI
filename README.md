CodeGeeks is an interactive, web-based quiz application designed to make learning engaging, fun, and effective. The app allows users to test their knowledge through a series of dynamically loaded multiple-choice questions with instant feedback. It is suitable for students, beginners in programming, and anyone who enjoys quick knowledge checks in a gamified format.

The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface where users can start a quiz, answer questions one by one, and immediately know whether their selected answer is correct or incorrect. This instant feedback helps users learn from mistakes in real time rather than waiting until the end of the quiz. A scoring system tracks correct answers and displays the final score at the end, motivating users to improve their performance.

CodeGeeks is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to run in any modern web browser without additional setup. JavaScript is used to handle core logic such as question loading, option selection, score calculation, and result display, while CSS ensures a visually appealing and responsive design across devices.

The quiz content can be easily modified or extended by updating the question data, allowing developers or educators to adapt the app for different subjects or difficulty levels. Overall, CodeGeeks combines simplicity, interactivity, and learning effectiveness, making it an ideal mini-project for web development practice as well as a useful educational tool
